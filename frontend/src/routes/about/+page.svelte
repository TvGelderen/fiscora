			Welcome to Fiscora, a personal finance tracking application born out
			of passion and curiosity.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl">A Personal Hobby Project</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Fiscora is not a company or a commercial venture. It's a personal
			hobby project created by an individual developer with a keen
			interest in finance and technology. This project stems from a desire
			to better understand personal finance management and to explore the
			intricacies of building a full-stack web application. The idea for
			Fiscora came from personal experiences with managing finances and a
			realization that existing tools didn't quite meet all my needs. I
			wanted to create something that could provide a comprehensive view
			of one's financial health while being intuitive and easy to use.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl">Learning and Growing</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Every aspect of Fiscora - from the backend architecture to the
			frontend design - represents a learning opportunity. This project
			has been a journey of discovery, allowing me to delve into various
			technologies and best practices in web development. As an open
			source project, Fiscora's entire codebase is available on GitHub for
			anyone to view, use, or contribute to. This transparency not only
			allows for collaboration but also ensures that users can see exactly
			how their data is being handled. If you're interested in exploring
			the code or contributing to the project, you can find the repository
			on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TvGelderen/fiscora">
				GitHub
			</a>
			.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-2xl">A Work in Progress</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Fiscora is continually evolving. As I learn more and receive
			feedback from users, new features are added and existing ones are
			refined. Your input is valuable in shaping the future of this
			project. Thank you for your interest in Fiscora. Whether you're here
			to use the application, learn from the code, or simply out of
			curiosity, I hope you find value in this project. If you have any
			questions, suggestions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach
			out.
		</p>

			Remember: Fiscora is a hobby project and should not be relied upon
			for professional financial advice. Always consult with a qualified
			financial advisor for important financial decisions.
